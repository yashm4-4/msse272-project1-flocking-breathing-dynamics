# Code Structure Philosophy

This repository follows a dual-layer organization used in professional scientific computing:

## 1. Jupyter Notebook (`notebooks/Project_1.ipynb`)
- Original exploratory coursework version  
- Step-by-step reasoning  
- Inline visualization  
- Assignment-driven experimentation  
- Intermediate outputs  

## 2. Modular Python Script (`src/simulate.py`)
- Clean, reusable, production-quality implementation  
- Generates a GIF of the simulation  
- Automatically cleans up temporary frame images  
- Easy to integrate into larger pipelines  
- Demonstrates engineering polish and maintainability
